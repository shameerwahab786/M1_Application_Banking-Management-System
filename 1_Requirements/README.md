## Introduction

```sh 
This Project is based With the number of client contacts rising by the day, the financial management system industry has witnessed some of the most rapid growth in the last year, and the database now contains all of the records. When it comes to handling money or important assets, it becomes an issue of credibility for both the service provider and the customer. Because everything is covered under one roof for consumer transparency, the banking management system is one of the most complicated systems. Every minute or second, everything from maintaining client information, account information, and transactions takes place.It not only saves transaction details and other data, but it also provides a report for use in other banking operations. Many procedures in this financial management system are automated, which makes it easier for the bank to operate. This lowers the need for manual labour, and automated operations will be mistake-free since they will only perform as intended, but human error is always a possibility when completing work manually.
